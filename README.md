# Bayes-Fit-of-Negative-Binomial
This script simulates data from a negative binomial, a truncated negative binomial, along with random effects to see how well we can recover parameter estimates using rStan. In addition to recover parameter estimates within the statistical model we use different priors to test the sensitivity of results to priors. 

Note, this takes a little while to run. Not sure if it's because of the truncated distribution; need to play with it more.
